# sudoku-solver
A relatively simple program that solves Sudoku puzzles.
On December 29, 2019, a friend and I made a bet to see who could make a better Sudoku Solver in two weeks.
Currently, using the techniques listed on https://www.kristanix.com/sudokuepic/sudoku-solving-techniques.php the program can look for Sole Candidates and Unique Candidates. I hope to employ more techniques soon.
We are also using https://sudoku.game/ to generate puzzles of varying difficulty.
